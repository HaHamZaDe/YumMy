The app provides a simple and intuitive user interface to browse through categories, view a list of meals under each category, and access detailed recipes for each meal. It leverages the power of React Navigation for seamless navigation between screens and fetching data from a remote API using a custom hook, enabling users to discover and learn more about their favorite recipes.
